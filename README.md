# Applying CoGuard to Improve Security in Infrastructure as Code Projects (Terraform, Pulumi, OpenTofu)

## Introduction

**Infrastructure as Code (IaC)** is an approach that allows managing and provisioning technology infrastructure automatically through machine-readable configuration files, instead of manually configuring servers and environments. With IaC, infrastructure resources (such as networks, virtual machines, databases, or load balancers) are defined in code, making standardization, versioning, and reproducibility easier.

This approach helps reduce human errors, improves scalability, and allows development and operations teams to work more efficiently, as infrastructure deployment becomes a fast, repeatable, and reliable process.

**SAST Tools (Static Application Security Testing)** analyze application source code to detect security vulnerabilities before the program runs. This static analysis allows early detection of issues during development, reducing costs and time compared to discovering vulnerabilities in production.

## What is CoGuard?

**CoGuard** is an open-source platform that enables automated security audits on Infrastructure as Code (IaC) configurations, containers, applications, cloud environments, and APIs. Its goal is to help development and operations teams detect and fix security issues before code is deployed to production.

### Key Features

- **Static Analysis for Configurations:** Detect vulnerabilities and insecure practices in IaC, containers, applications, cloud environments, and APIs before deployment.  
- **Automated Infrastructure Discovery:** Scans repositories, IaC, containers, applications, and cloud providers to provide a comprehensive view of running infrastructure.  
- **Intelligent Vulnerability Prioritization:** Focuses on the most critical vulnerabilities first, offering actionable remediation steps and avoiding noise from low-priority issues.
